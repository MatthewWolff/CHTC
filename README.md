This repository basically contains all of the jobs, scripts, aliases, and functions that I used to do work on the server for the Center of High-Throughput Computing. Some compartmentalization was done in terms of separating the scripts used for processing input files prior to mapping for the metagenomic pipeline, but overall the organization is fleeting. That said, documentation inside of the folders is thorough.
